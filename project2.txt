maybe implement new neighbor discovery reliability score

Wire up IP and LinkRouting 90m
Implement IP packets(same method as flooding packets) 30m
change flooding packets to use flooding protocol    10m
flooding forwards linkstate packets to linkRouting  10m
node forwards neigbor discovery and flooding packets to respective modules, but IP gets ping    10m
link state packets get forwarded by flooding to Link routing, IP uses link routing for routing table for ping. 20m
flooding, linkstate need to wait for neighbor discovery to be settled before posting their tasks, IP needs 
to wait for linkstate to be done before sending pings.  40m
Linkstate creates packets (increasing sequence number) and floods them  90m
Implement graph table from linkstate 90m
Implement Dijkstra 60m
Linkstate turns recieved packets into routing table 30m
When Neighbor Discovery changes it alerts all connected modules 20m
when neighbor discovery changes, send out new Linkstate, update table, update routing 20m
when new linkstate recieved, update table, and rerun routing 20m
