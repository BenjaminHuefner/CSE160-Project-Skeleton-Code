So, For neighbor discovery, i will occasionally broadcast an "I'm here" message.
there will be a function which recieves addresses from the ack message of the broadcast message,
and puts that info in the neighbor list.
A final third function returns a list of NeighborDiscovery

For flooding, there is one flood function.
the flood function takes in a message, and has at least one previous flood message stored
if the message is the same as the one stored, packet dies there
else, decrement TTL,
ask neighbor discovery for neighbors
if neighbors is empty, broadcast to all neighbors
else, simplesend to all neighbors, sans the sender
